## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to collect and analyze temperature data from the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sutainable year-round.

## Results

- One point of interest is that the mean temperature for June is 75 degrees and December is 71 degrees.
- Another point of interest is that the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees and 64 degrees for June.
- A final point of interest is that for the month of December the weather tends to trend around the mid to low 70's, although there is a max temp of 83. The month of June tends to trend from the mid to the upper 70's with a max of 85.

## Summary

Based on the data from the two tables, December tends to trend cooler than the month of July, which is to be expected. Although the temps are only a few degrees apart with the mean for December being 71 and the mean for June ia 75. With that being said, it looks like the temp year round should be ideal for a surfshop and decent for an ice cream place. December would probably be a slower time for both, since the weather tends to be on the color side more often. One additional query that could be performed to get better insight would be to see the average cloudiness of the time frames. With the temperatures being so close the cloudiness could effect the traffic to the shop, particularly in December since the temperatures are already close to the 60's and the business is greatly dependent on the weather. Another query we could make would be how often extreme weather conditions happen, like tropical storms or hurricanes. If there is a hurricane season, that information would be useful to determine insurance cost and a possible dead season.
